# Facial-Recognition
This software is designed to apply artificial intelligence to a real specific application (facial-recognition).

*It won't be so difficult to image another application of this software, using a neural network ( **MLP NN , Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network**) which is trained to recognize other object, different from the one that whe choose in this specific algorithm ( for example: Credit Card, QR Code & so on ).*

**P.S:** Don't take this software as a "must"...it's a rudimental script to better understand how facial recognition works (and how easy it can be implemented).

The algorithm implements a *Cascade Classifier*, more specifically **Haar Classifier for Object Detection** ( based on brightness characteristic of every human face; it uses only black-white images to do what I said before ) . 

If you are more interested to see how this specific Classifier works, there's a **useful link**:

Maybe it won't be so accurate, but it is very fast and simple to code ( just few lines of code ) and understand. 

In lot cases whe should have a trade-off/compromise between two or more issues ( in this case speed vs accuracy vs semplicity... the more the software is accurate, the less "fluent" & the more complex it would be ).
