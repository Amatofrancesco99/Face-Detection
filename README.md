# Facial-Recognition
This software is designed to apply artificial intelligence to a real specific application (facial-recognition).

Don't take this software as a "must"...it's a rudimental script to better understand how facial recognition works (and how easy it can be implemented).

Maybe it won't be so accurate, but it is very fast and simple to understand and code. 

In lot cases whe should have a trade-off/compromise between two or more issues (in this case speed vs accuracy vs semplicity... the more the sw is accurate, the less "fluent" & the more complex it would be).
